The files in this directory provide suggestions for customizing an
initialization file ("rc file") for latexmk.  See the latexmk
documentation for general information on its initialization files.

Not only do these files provide solutions to particular problems, but
they can be also used as inspiration for solutions to other cases.

NOTES: 

1. The examples are not complete rc files, but contain fragments that
   you can copy to one of your .latexmkrc/latexmkrc files.

2. These examples are developed by particular users to solve
   particular problems.  You may have to customize them for your own
   needs.  So read the comments carefully, and understand how the
   examples are working.

3. Another source of examples is in Herb Schulz's distribution of
   TexShop, at http://homepage.mac.com/herbs2, for some further
   examples.  (The file Latexmk321jTeXShop.zip is the one you want.)
   It shows how to use glossaries, epstopdf, pdftricks and pst-pdf.
